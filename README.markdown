Colors, by Matt Patenaude
=========================

Colors is a simple application for graphic designers, web designers, and anyone 
else who needs to be able to pull colors from what you can see on the screen. 
Colors takes Apple's basic color chooser (complete with "magnifying glass" to 
pull colors from other applications), and combines it with an easy way to copy 
common formats of color values (eg., #rrggbb, rgba(r, g, b, a), etc.) to the 
clipboard. In the newest version, you can even define your own patterns, and 
input colors using any valid CSS color declaration. Colors is a free download 
for anyone who would like to use it. Requires Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard).
